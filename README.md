# Wafer-Default-Detection
**Objective**
Predict Faulty wafers in the pipeline. A Pipeline has numerous wafers and our objective is to predict the wafers which have higher probability of being faulty so that the entire production pipeline doesn't come to a hault and we only fix the wafers of that particular segment.
